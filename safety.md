# COVID-19

## Remote Access

If you are sick or have potentially been exposed to COVID-19, *stay home*. There are no attendance points in this class, so you will not be penalized for missing class to keep our community safe. 

Below, we briefly describe the accommodations for students having to miss class due to illness or exposure.

- Lecture sessions: Course content is posted as a set of readings/videos that can be watch asynchronously.
- Support hours:  We will offer remote support hours each week.  As always, if you need to schedule a separate time to meet with course staff because none of the scheduled office hours work, [use this form](../followup).
- Asynchronous help via the Ed discussion board:   post online to get asynchronous help from a member of the course staff or your peers.

## Masking

See UWâ€˜s masking requirements [here](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/covid-19-prevention-and-response/face-covering-requirements).

## Social Distancing

Some students might feel more comfortable keeping a little distance. If you would like to keep space between you and another student, please  ask them to leave a space between you and them if there is room available. Similarly, if someone asks you to maintain a space between them, please respect that request if possible.

## What if you get sick?

See [this FAQ](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/faq/) from UW on what you should do if you get sick. You should also check out the remote access options listed above!

## What if Noah or a TA gets sick?

The course staff are committed to keeping you safe, so we will not make you risk a potential exposure to COVID to attend class. If Noah or your TA feels ill, we will move any in-person activities we are hosting (e.g., a class session or support hours) to be purely online or have someone else on the course staff fill in for us while we are potentially contagious.

Please make sure you check your email and the discussion board frequently and before you attend an in-person event to make sure it is still happening in-person. We will always try our best to give notice as early as possible for any changes from in-person to remote for a day.
